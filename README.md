Hello-World
===========

My first repository on GitHub!

I am just figuring out how to CODE!

Currently I am working on:

HTML
CSS
JavaScript

I want to pick up:

Java
C#
node.js
meteor.js

I find coding frustrating and awarding at the same time. I am always open to criticism so please help!

When I'm not coding I'd rather be:

Running
Walking the dog
Eating
Playing SC2
Flipping through Netflix
On XBOXONE

If you want to join me...PLEASE ASK! The more the merrier!
